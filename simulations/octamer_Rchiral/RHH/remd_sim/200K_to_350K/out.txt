Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

NOTE 1 [file npt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.52

NOTE 2 [file npt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.


This run will generate roughly 407 Mb of data

NOTE 1 [file npt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.

NOTE 2 [file npt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.


This run will generate roughly 407 Mb of data

Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 48x48x48, spacing 0.115 0.115 0.115
This run will generate roughly 407 Mb of data

NOTE 1 [file npt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.54

NOTE 2 [file npt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

NOTE 1 [file npt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.55

NOTE 2 [file npt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
