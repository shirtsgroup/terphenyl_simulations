    "# Applying BespokeFit to the mom-terphenyl system\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be used to generate OpenFF force field for the MOM-terphenyl system. We use mBuild to construct a short 3-mer of the polymer and get it's charges using AM1-BCC charges using OpenEye. Then using the BespokeFit workflow we will assign torsions/angles. Bespoke fit uses QM calculations on fragments present in our molecule to assign new more accurate torsion potentials."
