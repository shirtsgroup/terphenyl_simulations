# terphenyl_simulations

Repository for storing simulation input files and keeping track of changes to simulation inputs/parameters over time. This repo will primarily be used for running and analyzing Gromacs simulations on CU Boulder's Summit supercomputer. If additional submission scripts are needed, be sure to specify which super computer the submission script is written for (i.e. submit\_remd\_sim.bridges.slurm)
